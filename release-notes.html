<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li> Fixed: quickJump switched to matching single mail tab instead of jumping to Folder in current tab. 
  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/389">[issue 389]</a></li>
<li> Fixed navigation bar (current folder bar) positioning when switching between classic and vertical layout. 
  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/395">[issue 395]</a> </li>
<li> Also made sure that current folder tab layout is changed when a different theme is selected.</li>
<li> Resolved keyboard collision with quick filter toolbar; typing [Shift]+[F] and [Shift]+[M] in the search bar triggered the quickJump search.
  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/392">[issue 392]</a></li>

<li> Repaired: set keyboard focus back to thread pane after quickmove</li>
<li> QuickFolders did not detect if quickFilters assistant started automatically. This is now working even if quickFilters gets restarted from extension manager. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/397">[issue 397]</a></li>
</ul>

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
<ul>
  <li> Retired option to set QuickFolders toolbar position. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/380">[issue 380]</a></li>
  <li> After the license was viewed via the menu "check license status", now reset the "renew license" button for the day and return to normal toolbar icon (remove special coloring / message)</li>
</ul>


<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>
<li>Number shortcuts not working - move mail with Option+Shift+Number (Note that [ALT] shortcuts are already taken by Thunderbird, so we need to use CTRL (Windows, Linux) or OPTION (Apple) as modifier to activate tabs.
  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/387">[issue 387]</a></li>
</ul>
