	<h3>Latest News (15/04/2023) - Thunderbird 115 Compatibility</h3>
	<p>
		QuickFolders <a href="#5.15.2">5.15.2</a>  is fully compatible with the latest version
		of Thunderbird (102.10) - and currently supports up to version 110 beta 4.
		I am currently working on 
		<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/351">fundamental changes for Thunderbird 115</a> 
		which will be released in summer 2023 and has a completely 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/thunderbird-115-supernova-preview-the-new-folder-pane/">new 
		user interface "Supernova"</a>.
		This requires considerable work of <b>rewriting all elements interacting with the main page</b> 
		(3pane) of Thunderbird (toolbar buttons, menus, folder tree) - this also includes drag and drop.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my estimation, this work will take around 6 man-weeks. So it is very important that 
		this effort is funded via my Add-on licenses. There are 2 license levels - please
		read the <a href="premium.html#featureComparison">comparison chart</a> to see 
		which additional functions you get depending on your license.
		To download preview versions for Thunderbird betas or be informed about ongoing development
		on the new branch please leave feedback (or click the emoji button) at the
		<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/351">Github issue 351</a>.
		I am also discussing necessary changes to the UI, so please have your say there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thunderbird 115 is using the same system for permissions as the previous versions, and QuickFolders still
		has to use experimental APIs to achieve its full functionality. So you will see
		a message asking for full permissions. There is an 
		<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-thunderbird-extensions#w_have-full-unrestricted-access-to-thunderbird-and-your-computer">article on 
			Mozilla support</a> explaining the detail.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short: As Thunderbird  follows Firefox which moves toward web extensions, a 
		new technology has emerged that restricts Add-ons to use only 
		managed entry points (APIs) for adding functionality - these are still largely
		incomplete as regards the many things Add-ons can actually add to the application. That's 
		why Thunderbird allows using "experimental APIs", which is essentially a wrapper technology
		that allows (substantially modified) classic extensions to run on this system.
	</p>   
	<p>
	 This also meant yet again splitting the code base for the older versions and having separate releases
	 (it's not possible to combine both system in a single Add-on). Essentially new functionality
	 will go into the newer versions of QuickFolders (6.0 and higher) whereas I back-port bug fixes and some 
	 selected functionality to the older versions of QuickFolders (5.15 and higher).
	 Both versions will automatically update the correct user base as usual.

      <h4>Thunderbird 68 support has ended on thunderbird.net</h4>
      <p>
        Unfortunately thunderbird.net does not accept updates for legacy versions anymore - they only support the new "Mail extension" format and our "mail extension with experimental APIs" which is a workaround for missing advanced features.  
      </p>
      <p>
        From of version <a href="#4.23">4.23 forward</a> you have to install such legacy versions from the 
        <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickfolders/releases">github releases page</a>. 
      </p>

		<h3>Major Features</h3><br>

		<a name="quickJump"> </a>
			<h4>Premium Feature: quickJump</h4>
			<p>A super quick way to find folders and Tabs by entering part of their name:</p>
			<p>Click on the quickJump button (or use the configurable keyboard shortcut SHIFT+J 
			   in QuickFolders Pro):<br>
							 <img src="images/quickJump-Button.png" alt="quick Jump"/><br>
							 A Search box opens where you can type a folder name and hit [Enter]. Or hit the [Down] key
							 or mouse to select from the list of suggestions.<br>
							 <img src="images/FindFolder-box.png" alt="Find Folder results"/><br>
							 If exactly one matching folder is found Thunderbird will jump to it immediately. If multiple folders match a dropdown will show.
							 Selecting the folder (or tab) name will jump to the folder.<br>
							 Select Find Folder from the menu again if you want to hide the search box.
			</p>
		<a name="quickMove"> </a>
			<h4>Premium Feature: quickMove</h4>
			<p>Uses the same button for moving mails to any folder:</p>
			<p>Simply drag some mails up to the quickJump button (or use the configurable keyboard shortcut SHIFT+M in 
			   QuickFolders Pro), and then type the name of the 
				 target folder. The name is shown in red to indicate that mails are going to be moved. 
				 Note that you can gather mails multiple times and even from different folders - 
				 the mails won't be moved to the destination until you click on the suggestion on 
				 the search box.</p>
			<p><img src="images/quickMove-drag.png" /><br/>
				 Start typing to get relevant folder suggestions:<br/>
				 <img src="images/quickMove-searchList.png" /><br>
				 Clicking a folder name will move the dragged emails to the new destination and 
				 complete the quickMove operation.
			</p>
			<p>You can also use this button for jumping to a folder by clicking it (quickJump).</p>
      <p>
        To access child folders of any given folder use the key "/" - just enter the first characters of the parent 
        folder followed by "/". This will additionally give you the option to create new subfolders before you move 
        the mail.
      </p>
			<p>
				 The Escape key will hide the red box temporarily. You can right-click the button 
				 to display more options and the list of emails that are lined up for moving:<br/>
				 <img src="images/quickMove-context.png" /><br/>
				 You can open the emails in a tab by clicking them.
			</p>	 


			<h4>Palette Types</h4>
			<p>It is now possible to select independent palettes for the different tab states 
				 selected / hover / dragover / uncolored.: <br>
				 <img src="images/palette/PaletteOptions.png" alt="new palette selections" class="screenshot"/>
				 </p>
			<p>this way the signalling of important states (such as the current folder)	 can be made to 
				 stick out so it can be located much more easily.</p>
			<p>Also the new architecture of palette options makes it easier to add different 
				 palettes in future versions.</p>

          <p>
            The quickFilters assistant was triggered multiple times when dropping multiple mails to tab
            or multiple mails are moved using quickMove. This new version will move emails together,
            as long as they come from an identical source folder. This should prevent multiple assistant
            windows in the majority of use cases.

            Fixed: Significant slowdown of Thunderbird 102 with QuickFolders
          </p>
          <p>
            There is some inefficiency in Thunderbird code for the folder tree
            which can be exacerbated by QuickFolders. I have removed as many function calls as 
            possible without impacting on functionality. On startup some context menus 
            have to be generated for efficient drag+drop; this is now postponed to a later stage to 
            yield some processing time to the User Interface.

          Fixed: Thunderbird 102 - current category is not remembered / selected; in this 
          solution I store the current category of each tab (folder and messages) whenever 
          a tab is opened / moved or closed. 
          
          This information is only stored for the last Thunderbird  window that is closed.        </li>

          There is some inefficent code in Thunderbird 102 at the moment, so I have started 
          to use their own internal function to generate this; I am hoping there will be 
          some improvement added in Thunderbird itself in a later version and will remind 
          the core team.

          Thunderbird 102 is severely slowing down compared to Thunderbird 91 with QuickFolders installed.
          I am currently working on a permanent solution - if you would like to test preview versions
          you can download them at the Github issue linked above.
        </li>
      
        <h4 class="inList">Maintenance Version 5.10.2 - 07/07/2022</h4>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/281">[issue 281]</a>
            5.10.2 - this maintenance version will be able to reconstruct tabs after upgrading from 
            Thunderbird 91 to 102 even if the server and username have been modified due to 
            <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573690">bug 1573690</a>.
            To successfully reconstruct (and avoiding invalid tabs) is only possible
            if <b>5.10.1 was previously run on an older profile (Thunderbird 91 or older)</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you already upgraded to Thunderbird 102 previously and experience invalid tabs,
            you can now generate troubleshooting information via right-click <i>QuickFolders Commands / 
            Tab Specific Properties...</i> This will copy the assumed account and the (invalid) folder URI
            to the clipboard.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/troubleshoot-invalidtab-info.png" alt="invalid tab info">
          </p>
          <p>
            For reference you can click on any real folder in the folder tree and then SHIFT+Click
            on the QuickFolders tool icon, then select <i>Debug / Copy current folder info!</i>
            This will copy the account and correct expected URI to the clipboard.
            By comparison of these data points it I can fix your folders through exporting 
            the folder configuration and then text search+replace the differing URIs 
            (or by simply inserting the correct account)<br>

          Fixed the missing close [x] icon on the advanced tab properties panel, which was hidden 
          by style changes in Thunderbird 102.

        <li>

          5.10.1 - this maintenance fix stores the account id for every tab. 
          When upgrading to Thunderbird 102, this can potentially rename the servers due to 
          <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573690">bug  1573690</a>
          - then the account can be used for reconstruction of invalid folders.
          I am currently working on code that can help in fixing this problem automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed icon spacings in folder popup menus in Tb102.

        <h4 class="inList">Version 5.10 - 12/06/2022 - Thunderbird 102 Specific changes</h4>
        <li>
          Increasing maximum TB version for next ESR - Thunderbird 102.* is planned to be supported from now on.
          Also increased minimum version to 92.0 - because of new APIs 78 will not be supported with new features / bugfixes.
          
          <div class="psa announcement">
            If you consider updating to Thunderbird 102 please make a backup of your prefs.js - Thunderbird 
            can potentially generate invalid tabs, and this can be repaired much more easily by knowing certain
            server settings that are stored in prefs.js preceding migration. 
            See <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/281">[issue 281]</a> for detailed information!

        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/272">[issue 272]</a>
          Implemented new folder listener interface. The new version of Thunderbird implements a different 
          folder listener interface. This meant a lot of functions (such as updating URLs when renaming
          folders and updating their connected tabs or updating unread counts on the tabs) were broken.
        </li>        
        <li>

          Updating to Thunderbird 102 can generate invalid tabs - make sure to backup

            Simplified recent folders menu behavior for keyboard navigation.
            <p>
              <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/254">[issue 254]</a> 
              The new [=] shortcut key of quickMove/quickJump showed an arrow to visit child folders, which meant that the 
              folder itself could not be opened without mouse, which impeded the workflow.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have decided to instead not show subfolders for these recent folders as it doesn't add much value
              for what essentially should be a repeat operation. I have also extended this to the other recent 
              folders menus (e.g. on the recent folders tab). 
            </p>
            <p> 
              One can still restore the old behavior (of showing subfolders) by setting the config setting
              <tt>extensions.quickfolders.recentfolders.subfolders = true</tt>.
              To do this you can open QuickFolders <i>General Settings</i> and right-click the 
              <i>Recent Folder Tabs</i> checkbox:<br>

              <img class="screenshot" src="images/recent-config-settings.png" alt="advanced recent settings"/>

            using quickJump / quickMove via shortcut - hitting Enter will now always select the last successful

            Convert options dialog to pure HTML. Amon other things, this fixes the color pickers that have stopped
            working on Mac. Long term, all Dialogs and User Interfaces need to be converted to HTML
            to become future proof and pure API based. There are still things that cannot be done with HTML
            right now (such as folder dropdowns that aren't cut off at the toolbar borders), so this is 
            an ongoing effort for the predictable future.

					<a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page" target="_blank">QuickFolders Pro</a> and Standard, and the unfunded version will have a number of restrictions. 
					Most importantly, no more than 10 tabs are supported without any license. 
					This is necessary in order to fund ongoing and future work so that the Add-on won't be lost to all users when Thunderbird moves away from experimental APIs.
					Standard Features will be <a href="https://quickfolders.org/premium.html#stdfeat">listed here.</a>

				<li> 
					<p>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/155">[issue 155]</a> 
						Significant new search features have been added to the quickMove / quickJump function. 
						For help on these, you can now click the [?] symbol to the right of the search field.<br>
						<img class="screenshot" src="images/search-help.png" /> 
					</p> 
					<p>
						Support entering multiple words in a search string to find longer folder names that are composited, such as
						"Fred.Flintstone" "Invoices June 2020" "Research+Development". These can now be found by entering
						the starting letters of the words within the folder name, in any order. e.g. "f f" "2020 inv" "Dev Res".<br>
						<img class="screenshot" src="images/multi-search-1.png" /> 
					</p>
					<p>
						The following characters are regarded as word boundaries and don't need to be typed:
						<tok>_</tok> <tok>.</tok> <tok>-</tok> <tok>+</tok> <tok>&amp;</tok> <tok>@</tok> <br>
						<img class="screenshot" src="images/multi-search-3.png" /> 
					</p>
					<p>
						This can also be combined with the parent folder syntax by entering the parent folder start followed by a forward slash <tok>/</tok>:<br>
						<img class="screenshot" src="images/multi-search-2.png" />
					</p>
					<p>
						The new character <tok>&gt;</tok> can be used to skip any part within the path 
						and if you do not know their order within the folder hierarchy.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					When the search box is opened there is a new button to display a help panel:<br>
					<img class="screenshot" src="images/search-help.png" /> <br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The update Splash screen with the translated list of new features which used to be opened on update 
						will from now on not be displayed automatically anymore. Instead there is a message on the QuickFolders button 
						- click it once to read the latest news when you want. 
						<img class="screenshot" src="images/qf-toolbar-whats-new.png"><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The splash screen can also be re-opened again from the tools menu:</br>
						<img class="screenshot" src="images/show-splash.png"><br>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Improved overall performance for typing by optimizing the keyboard listener that handles
					global shortcuts.
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
					[web extension migration] Improved many functions that worked via accessing the "most recent Thunderbird window" 
					and replaced them with event notifications that propagate to every window.
					This uses the Notification Tool library and the background script (a mechanism of the new API based "mail extensions" model).
					</p>
					<p>
						This way all Thunderbird windows (if you work from multiple windows) will be updated correctly when doing one of the following actions.
						All these now work simultaneously and update in multiple Thunderbird windows.          
						<ul>
							<li>rename a tab</li>
							<li>move a tab positionto a different position</li>
							<li>delete a tab or remove it from or add it to a category</li>
							<li>change the layout of all QuickFolders toolbar elements from the options dialog (themes, colors)</li>
							<li>rename QuickFolders categories</li>
							<li>change the theme / buttons of the Current Folder Bar</li>
							<li>change options of where to display the Current Folder Bar (main window, message tab, single message window)</li>
							<li>changes to the license when entered / validated</li>
							<li>unlocking features such as the advanced / tab-specific properties when a license key is entered</li>

					which allows for entering parent names by entering text within the string if that starts with an

				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/135">[issue 135]</a>
						quickMove / quickJump: When using "/" for parent folders searching for substrings should work better...
						The Search algorithm now recognizes Underscore _ and Space within folder names so that parent folders with 
						prefixes such as "01_test" can still be found without knowing the number (type "test\subfoldername" to get 
						a match in this example). 
				</li>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/134">[issue 134]</a>
					Feature Request: Escape key to "Cancel quickMove" completely. Before this change, Cancel would hide the search box but 
					keep the list of mails queued to be moved so that more items could be added later.
					If necessary, the old behavior can be restored in the Advanced search settings dialog. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/132">[issue 132]</a>
					In a single message tab, quickMove used to redisplay the mail after moving it with quickMove.
					This behavior has now been changed on request to go to the next email.
					If necessary, this new behavior can be changed via the advanced search settings button
					in the Single Message Tab box on the QF Pro settings tab.<br>

				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/136">[issue 136]</a>
					Fixed: There were no folder suggestions during quickJump / quickMove while viewing mails in a virtual

				</li>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/140">[issue 140]</a>

					pattern.

					In order to maintain full functionality for the next 12 months forward, QuickFolders had to be rewritten as a mail extension 
					with experimental API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to 
					do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all

				<h4 class="inList">Bug Fixes</h4>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/72">[issue 72]</a>
					Fixed: Category "_Uncategorized" erratically showed all categories after moving a folder to another category
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/76">[issue 76]</a>
					Fixed: Recent Folders List is not updated until Thunderbird is closed and reopened
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/80">[issue 80]</a>
					Fixed: Recent Folders list not updated when moving email using drag and drop to the folder tree. I have 
					made the updating of this folder time stamp somewhat more aggressive, but avoiding to add folders 
					like Inbox, Sent, Archives, Drafts, Junk, Trash and Templates because they would always 
					end up on top.
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/79">[issue 79]</a>
					Fixed: Drag over color + Dropmarkers when reordering Tabs not working<br>
					<img src="images/drag-dropmarkers.png" alt="dragover state repaired" /><br>
					This was caused by an experimental style selector [<tt>-moz-drag-over</tt>] which has been now removed by Mozilla 
					due to little take-up of the HTML community. I had to rewrite these parts using pure JavaScript.
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/81">[issue 81]</a>
					Fixed: Current Folder Toolbar display - text is always black
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/84">[issue 84]</a>
					Fixed: Can't drag envelope icon in Navigation bar (a.k.a. Current Folder) to a folder / QuickFolder drop target.
					Also the Navigation Bar is hidden if multiple mails or a thread is selected.<br>
					<img src="images/mail-drop-targets.png" alt="valid drop targets" /><br>
					Drag envelope icon to move the currently selected mails to these targets, or into the folder tree if needed.
				</li>
				<li> 
					In the dialog "change order of tabs" the <i>Up</i> and <i>Down</i> labels on the buttons were 
					not rendered for some yet unknown reason - this is now worked around by removing the button styling from these elements
				</li>
				<h4 class="inList">Improvements</h4>
				<li> Hide option to extend license if it is already more than 1 year into the future. </li>
				<li> Hide popup screen for licensed users who have > 40 days left on their license </li>
				<li> Improve legibility of dropdown items in themed  QuickFolders options dialog. Especially affects users of dark themes. </li>
				<h4 class="inList">Miscellaneus</h4>
				<li> Removed Encryption test code from options.js </li>
				<li> validateFilterTargets moved to other module to avoid console errors.</li>
				<li> Improved reopening any support sites already open in a tab by jumping to the correct place if necessary.</li>

			<h4>
			<a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/quickfolders-tabbed-folders/versions/5.0" >Version 5.0 - 17/11/2020</a>
			</h4>
			<p>
				This is the new version of QuickFolders whis is fully compatible with Thunderbird 78.
			</p>
				
			<ul>
				<h4 class="inList">Thunderbird 78 Conversion</h4>
				<li> 
					In order to maintain full functionality for the next 12 months forward, QuickFolders had to be rewritten as a mail extension 
					with experimental API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to 
					do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all 
					functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - 
					eventually QuickFolders will also use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created 
					and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the nexty 12 months forward - please 
					support this with a license or donation:</li>
				<li>
					You can <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page">buy a license</a> 
					here. This is the preferred way of funding all the ongoing work and improvements.</li>
				<li>If you are not ready for a license you can also <a href="https://quickfolders.org/donate.html#donate">donate from here</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<h4 class="inList">Changes / Work Items</h4>
				<li>
					Removed backwards compatible (shim) code and all code implementing cross-compatibiliy 
					for SeaMonkey and Postbox. The code base had to be forked into a new branch, so if I backport 
					bug fixes this will double my work for the legacy Thunderbird users.</li>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/35">[issue 35]</a> "Skip Unread Folder" hides "Add star" function... the Shortcut for 
					skipping unread folders works even without pressing the Shift key</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						New icon layout base on the new <a href="https://style.thunderbird.net/">Photon Design System</a> for Thunderbird. 
						The fantastic new Icon conversion was kindly and expertly done by Richard Paenglab.<br>
						<img src="images/tb78-toolbar.png" alt="new toolbar icons" />
					</p>
					<p>
						The Navigation Bar (current folder toolbar) has also been redesigned:<br>
						<img src="images/tb78-navigation-bar.png" alt="new navigation bar layout" />
					</p>
					<p> Apart from that, all menu configuration as well as theming options and colors for the QuickFolders Tabs are still available:<br>
						<img src="images/tb78-advanced-options.png" alt="new advanced options" />
					</p>
					<p>
						Folder tree icons can also still be overwritten with external icons (here is <a href="premium.html#icons">a small icon collection</a> for 
						QuickFolders Pro users)<br>
						<img src="images/tb78-foldertree-icons.png" alt="new advanced options" />
					</p>
				</li>
				<li> Removed nsIRDFService dependencies</li>
				<li> rewrote preference bindings in all dialogs</li>
				<li> Added new Thunderbird 78 compatible Icons (svg)</li>
				<li> rewrote search algorithm for missing mails in reading list - clicking on a missing mail there brings up a search dialog. Unfortunately this was not populated with meaningful search conditions</li>
				<li> Klaus Buecher (@Opto) did the initial conversion of all XUL interface and fixed some bugs. 
					John Bieling (from the Thunderbird team) helped with the WindowLoader implementation and fixing the broken preferences. 
					Many thanks to both of themn for their fantastic work!</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<h4 class="inList">Known issues</h4>
				<li>
					Any dragover styling (special color, dropmarkers when moving tabs around) is currently broken - this is caused by an experimental style selector which has been now removed by Mozilla due to little take-up of the HTML community. We will need to recode these parts using JavaScript.
