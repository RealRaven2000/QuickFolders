<b> Maintenance Fixes </b>
<li> Version 5.15.2:

will not trigger quickFilters assistant multiple times anymore when dropping multiple mails to a tab.</li>
<li> Version 5.15.1:

A regression in v5.15 caused all text in popup menus (subfolders / commands) to appear missing for most users. This was because of the default size of 0 being falsely applied as a literal value. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/333">[issue 333]</a></li>
<li> Version 5.15.2 (WIP):

The quickFilters assistant was triggered multiple times when dropping multiple mails to tab or multiple mails are moved using quickMove. This new version will move emails together, as long as they come from an identical source folder. This should prevent multiple assistant windows in the majority of use cases. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/335">[issue 335]</a>
</li>
        
<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/315">[issue 315]</a> Remove the term 'Orphaned Tabs' in all User Interface texts</li>
<li> Modifications to internal code for triggering the quickFilters filter assistant to avoid "monkey patching" (overwriting) Thunderbird internal functions. These changes are needed from the next version of quickFilters (5.7 and higher) onwards to avoid duplicate prompts for filter creation. </li>
<li> Set max version to Thunderbird 108 for users of beta version. </b>
</ul>
