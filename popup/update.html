    <h1>{addon} Update</h1>
    <p>Thank you for updating {addon}. You are now running v. {version} on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
    
    <p>My Add-ons are currently undergoing fundamental changes in order to
      remain compatible with the Mozilla platform. Changes there have been
      increasingly more complex to the point that the annual conversion 
      effort to the new ESR period takes a considerable amount of time
      and resources.</p>
      
    <p>In the case of {addon}, alterations to the new legacy-less
      model already took multiple weeks and are still ongoing, while 
      it is likely that we will be losing some functionality. With a 
      complex Add-on like this its inevitable.</p>
      
    <h2>Cost and Benefit</h2>
    
    <p>Software  development costs time and money - unlike many platform apps,
      Add-ons are not written
      by large corporations, nor are they sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
      Mozilla only provide us with a platform to bring our software to you,
      the end users - if we need to charge or ask for help we cannot do
      this from addons.thunderbird.net - it is not an "app store" with built in
      paywalls or license management like iTunes or google play.</p>
      
    <p>In order to remain useful, Add-on authors have to now raise the funds
      necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
      from the functionality we bring to the table. </p>
      
    <p>To help {addon} stay functional and alive:</p>
