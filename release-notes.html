<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/315">[issue 315]</a> Remove the term 'Orphaned Tabs' in all User Interface texts</li>
<li> Modifications to internal code for triggering the quickFilters filter assistant to avoid "monkey patching" (overwriting) Thunderbird internal functions. These changes are needed from the next version of quickFilters (5.7 and higher) onwards to avoid duplicate prompts for filter creation. </li>

<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/333">[issue 333]</a> 5.15.1 A regression caused all text in popup menus (subfolders / commands) to appear missing for most users. This was because of the default size of 0 being falsely applied as a literal value. </li>
