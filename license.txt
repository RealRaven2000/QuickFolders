Pro Version
This Program contains a subset of features "Premium Features" which are protected by 
a paid registration scheme. Registration keys can be obtained via various licensing links
from within the software (Options/QuickFolders Pro tab, QuickFolders context menu, 
premium notification messages). The profits from Registration are used to develop
and distribute the program further and to feed the author, as he would like to spend
more time developing open source software. Some Premium features may be available in 
the free software, but they may be restricted (e.g. through a notification to the 
registration). Premium features are not essential to the core functionality of 
the Program, but are there to provide an incentive for financially supporting the 
enhancement and support of the Software. 

Registration Scheme
Registration is carried out via our web shop (FastSpring) which sells registration keys.
Registration keys are personal, non-transferrable and usually restricted to a time period
(typically one year). To protect their personal nature they are tied to the user's 
Email address.

Motivation 
As regards licensing, we want to avoid a situation where the project is reused 
in order to avoid our monetisation by giving this away for free or cheaper than us 
thus disincentivising the current developers from putting a lot of time into 
development and support.
