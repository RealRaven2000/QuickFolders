<b>Functionality converted to Thunderbird 115</b>
<ul>
<li> Rewritten QuickFolders toolbar to show in a different element (SuperNove wants all buttons displayed in their new Unified toolbar). All Folder menus remain as xul items for now as they are difficult to recreate in HTML. The new main styling including custom icons in the QuickFolders tab has been implemented.</li>
<li> Following the Firefox model, Thunderbird 115 allows only one single action button (I am currently negotiating with the thunderbird team to allow more optional buttons) I decided to add the toolbar toggle button to the unified toolbar. With this the QuickFolders toolbar can be hidden temporarily.

When you install QuickFolders in Tb115 for the first time, all Add-on buttons are added on the top right - you may  move it by right-clicking the unified toolbar and selecting customize.  </li>
<li> Recent Folders had to be rewritten. </li>
<li> Drag &amp; Drop was broken and had to be fixed.  </li>
<li> Rewritten the event listeners in folder tree (drag and drop) </li>
<li> The Navigation toolbar (a.k.a. Current Folder Bar) in center screen had to be reimplemented because there are now multiple 3pane documents / windows (one for each Thunderbird tab) Also I am now hiding unneccesary elements of the toolbar when it is displayed  in the single message tab or single message window.</li>
<li> Implemented main toolbar buttons (Show QuickFolders toolbar) as Unified toolbar action button.</li>
<li> Storage of QuickFolders category per tab is now implemented with the new tab sessions API. </li>
<li> Most of the icons in the options window have been redesigned as svg graphics for a modernized look and feel. Also, dark theme support has been improved.</li>

<b>Issues / Open Points</b>
<li> New CSS rules for folder tree icons: as the folder tree has been rewritten as HTML list, we cannot use the foldertreeitem.getProperties function to store this information anymore. Instead we need an new method to store this information separately - and then rules for styling the folders have to be recreated. This may take a little while - I am considering writing a tool to extract the information from older versions of Thunderbird (91 or 102) so they can be migrated to 115 later.  </li>
<li> Toolbar buttons Create folder, Skip Folder can currently not be added (because the mail toolbar is gone and unified toolbar only allows noe single button per Add-on)</li>
<li> When a QuickFolders Tab is selected, Thunderbird still needs to scroll the folder tree to that folder.</li>
</ul>
