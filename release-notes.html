<b>Release 5.3</b>
<ul>
<li> In order to maintain full functionality, this Add-on had to be rewritten as a mail extension with experiment API, which will require full permissions on installation. As regards being allowed to do stuff, it is actually not different with any classic Add-on: they always had full access to all functions within Thunderbird. The modern mail extensions will have much more tightly managed permissions - eventually QuickFolders will also be able use this more modern approach - but the APIs for this have to be created and accepted by Mozilla first. This means a lot of ongoing work for the next 12 months forward - please support this with a license or donation:</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page">buy a license</a> here. This is the preferred way of funding all the ongoing work and improvements.</li>
<li>If you are not ready for a license you can also <a href="https://quickfolders.org/donate.html#donate">donate from here</a></ul>

<b>Fixed Thunderbird 78 Regressions</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/106">[issue 106]</a> Backup function does not save general / advanced / layout settings.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/108">[issue 108]</a> Some changes in options window are ignored and not stored. Settings that could not be changed from the options screen: 
- Premium / quick move display format 
- General / Message Navigation / Go to next unread mail.

Also, many layout settings were not updating immediately through the User Interface, because of broken instant apply settings. 
</li>
<li> Fixed highlighting of drop targets when dragging mails into a subfolder.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/111">[issue 111]</a> Paint Mode stopped working in Thunderbird 78. You can now use Paint Mode again from the QuickFolders tools menu to change the colors of multiple tabs. (For best results use the flat style theme).

Activate paint mode, then select a color from the palette and click on the tabs you want to change:

The colors displayed depend on the selected "Palette for Colored Tabs" which is a global setting and offers 3 choices (Standard, Pastel and Night Vision for dark themes). </li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/101">[issue 101]</a> If multiple categories are selected, closing QuickFolders settings reverts to "Show All". </li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/88">[issue 88]</a> Fixed highlighting of drop targets when dragging mails into a subfolder. </li>
</ul>

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/82">[issue 82]</a> Improved sorting of search results during quickMove / quickJump.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/109">[issue 109]</a> Menu item Mark Messages read in Folder + subfolders not displayed as expected - it was only shown if the folder of the tab didn't have unread emails itself. This additional menu item that can be used to set subfolders read was only displayed if the actual folder of the tab itself had no unread emails, and only child folders had them. Configure this command in QuickFolders settings / Advanced / Menu Configuration / Mail Commands</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/37">[issue 37]</a> When no match is found using the "/" in quickMove box, display "No matching parent folders!" instead of "..."</li>
</ul>
