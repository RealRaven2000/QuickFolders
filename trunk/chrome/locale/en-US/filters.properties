qf.filters.template.from.description=This is probably the most used pattern:  this will retrieve the sender's email address and paste it into the from and to filter conditions fields. This way complete conversations with the sender will be moved to the new folder.
qf.filters.template.to.description=Similar to 'Based on Sender': use this when you mark an email you have sent to somebody else. This will retrieve the recpient's email address and paste it into the from and to filter conditions fields. This way the complete conversation with the contact will be moved to the new folder.
qf.filters.template.list.description=Similar to Based on Sender, but it doesn't fill the 'to' condition field.
qf.filters.template.topic.description=This will look for special expressions in brackets, e.g. [stamp collectors] or {vegans} and create a filter condition based on these; a lot of mass email is set up using this pattern, so it is really easy to use.
qf.filters.template.tag.description=Uses the tags of the email and adds them as filter conditions.
