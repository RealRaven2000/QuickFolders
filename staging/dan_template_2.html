          Dear <span class="recipient">Johnny Blogger</span>,

        </p>

        <p>
          My name is Dan Amos and I work with Garrett Zoller and Tim O'neil in the 
          real estate industry producing a variety of films, photography and 
          other forms of media. I am reaching out today to offer my services 
          to other Land and Wildlife realtors. I have 20 years of experience 
          behind a camera and that knowledge can give your listings a unique look
          that can separate you from the competition. I produce striking images and 
          cohesive films that celebrate each property individually.  
        </p>

        <p>
          I will work with you and your clients to make sure all needs are met when 
          producing media for the listing.  My services remove stress from your end 
          and cover all important media like: Photography, Drone Work, Video, 
          Script Writing, Voice Over and more. I am FAA Certified with a Part 107 license 
          and proficient in highlighting details about each listing. I will make sure we 
          are RMLS compliant and I will go the extra mile to get those beautiful shots. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Thank you for taking a moment of your time to read this email and be sure to
