<b>Maintenance Bugfixes 5.17.1</b>
<ul>
<li>You can once again use the filter assistant to create filter rules with quickMove. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/385">[issue 385]</a> </li>
<li>Corrected the reported number of messages moved when using quickMove. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/354">[issue 354]</a></li>

</ul>

<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li> Tabs for unified folders (such as Unified Inbox) now support showing the actual folders, renamed to their account names.</li>
<li> Redesigned menu icons and fixed a number of issues in the options screen - icons had  some problems changing to dark themes.If you experience missing colors in QuickFolders settings, you can enable the about:config setting <tt> svg.context-properties.content.enabled = true </tt></li>
<li> Automatically back up the custom folder icons for future restauration in Thunderbird 115.
</ul>

On startup, QuickFolders will automatically backup custom icons on the folder tree (all folder URLs and the locations of their icons) in the file quickFolders-FolderTree.json which will be stored in the profile/extensions folder. This will be only done once automatically. 

The backup function can be also invoked manually via the QuickFolders debug menu - to access, click on QuickFolders tools button while holding down SHIFT, and then select <i>Debug / Backup folder tree icons</i>.</li>
</ul>
