<b>Release 5.16</b>
            
I am currently working on the conversion of the QuickFolders Addon for the new Thunderbird SuperNova UI. This will be implemented in the next major version of Thunderbird 115 in Summer 2023.

You can read up on the current progress of this work here: <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/351">[issue 351]</a>


As this work is exclusively funded by the sale of licenses, please consider buying a license or renewing your previous one if you are interested in using QuickFolders in the future

<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li> Added visible warning about license 10 days before expiry. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/350">[issue 350]</a></li>
<li> News button will not be shown unless at least minor version number of QuickFolders is increased. But you can always read up on the latest changes via the tools menu item "Latest Update News..." - and used to be titled "View Splash Screen". </li>
<li> Added pricing section to the buy license dialog. This explains that prices can be looked up via the browser without necessarily buying, by clicking the appropriate button on the screen. </li>
</ul>

<b>Bugs Fixed</b>
<ul>
<li> Fixed "Compact Folder" on current folder submenu.</li>
<li> Corrected the Number of days left in license by rounding up. </li>
</ul>
