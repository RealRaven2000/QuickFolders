<li class="psa"> I am currently paying somebody to migrate all my Add-on support sites away from the free host on mozdev.org, which is going to close operation end of June. To keep having support sites and ongoing development, please <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page">buy a license</a> (the migration will cost around $500, so there are some expense I hope to recover from the user community).

I will also have to rewrite all mail Add-ons as web extensions, which is currently not yet possible as all necessary APIs to replace the deprecated tech has not been implemented. As in between step I plan to release QuickFolders as a "web experiment" for Thunderbird 78+ but this will take a few weeks of work. If you are interested in using a version of  QuickFolders that works with Thunderbird 78, <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfolders?referrer=qf-version-page">buy a license</a> to support the project.</li>

<li> IMPROVEMENT IN 4.18:<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/27">[issue 27]</a> Drag to Create New Subfolders from tab could create unexpected results, if the entered folder name contained spaces. The space (and possibly other non-ASCII characters, such as Umlauts / diacritics),  would be url encoded (Space = <code>%20</code>) and could lead to failure of moving the mail or duplicated folders or non-working QuickFolders tabs.

This problem was reported during the thunderbird 68.* release cycle so the fix may affect older versions of Thunderbird negatively. For user of older Thunderbird versions the behavior can be reverted by using the configuration setting: <code>extensions.quickfolders.newFolderCallback.encodeURI  = true</code></li>

<li> FIXED IN 4.18.1:<br><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/34">[issue 34]</a> Option to make QuickFolders appear at the Bottom of Other Toolbars

The new setting <i>Advanced / QuickFolders Bar Position</i> can be used to change the order of toolbars to push the QuickFolders bar further up / down in case other 3rd party toolbars are used. Set to 0 to have the toolbar at the top, 100 should work to push it below all other toolbars.

The default is now set to make QuickFolders appear at the bottom of the mail tools again.</li>
